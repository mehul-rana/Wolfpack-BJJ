# Wolfpack BJJ

This purpose of this project was to practice building a responsive website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This website was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to ensure a responsive experience regardless of what device is used to view the website.

## Optimizations

I would love to add a section devoted to the class schedules to help users find a class and time that works for them.

## Lessons Learned:

With the focus of this project being responsive design, I strengthened my knowledge of how to create websites that conform to different sized screens.
