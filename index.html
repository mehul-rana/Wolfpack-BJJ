					<h3>Physical Benefits</h3>
					<p>
						If you’re trying to shed the extra pounds, BJJ is a great form of exercise. You’re constantly engaging multiple muscle groups in every Jiu Jitsu class. The constant movement from warmups at the start of class to rolling during open mat will help you burn calories. Since grappling arts such as BJJ involve your entire body, your cardiovascular system will get stronger.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the natural benefits of learning BJJ is you improve your flexibility and overall mobility. BJJ teaches you how to move more efficiently. Your range of motion will be better as a result of doing warmups and drilling techniques you learn in class. Your body will get stronger as you train consistently.

					<h3>Mental Benefits</h3>
					<p>
						Consistently doing difficult things will help you be able to focus more. BJJ teaches you to be mentally present. You learn how to commit your brainpower towards whatever you’re trying to accomplish such as finishing a submission or recovering from a hard throw. This ability to focus will help you in other areas of your life such as work and family relationships.
					</p>
					<p>
						Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gives you regular opportunities to test out solutions to problems you’re dealing with on the mat. You receive instant feedback as to whether or not what you’re doing works. This style of learning can be encouraging as you encounter problems outside of your gym since learning a new skill helps you develop stronger neural connections.

					<h3>Other Benefits</h3>
					<p>
						While training can be physically and mentally challenging, it’s not uncommon to see everyone on the mat smiling. You’ll have a great time as you work with your friends and grow together on your Jiu Jitsu journey.
					</p>
					<p>
						There’s nothing like the BJJ community! You’ll get to experience the bond that comes from training together. As you learn and grow, you will be able to create lifelong memories and friendships.
